# API KEY PRIORITY GUIDE
# ==========================================
# 
# REQUIRED for basic functionality:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (for GPT models)
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for Claude models)
#
# RECOMMENDED for maximum model diversity:
# - GOOGLE_API_KEY (for Gemini models with thinking capabilities)
# - APILLM_API_KEY (for latest Llama models + DeepSeek via APillm)
#
# OPTIONAL for additional capabilities:
# - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (if you prefer direct DeepSeek API over APillm)
# - HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN (for additional open-source models)
# - GITHUB_API_TOKEN (for MCP GitHub integration)
#
# Note: The system will automatically detect available API keys
# and configure the corresponding models. More API keys = more
# model diversity = better autonomous consensus decisions!# Email configuration added to .env.example
