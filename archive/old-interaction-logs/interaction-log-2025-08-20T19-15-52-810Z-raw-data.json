    "prompt": "Build a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that includes an automated market maker (AMM) with dynamic fee structures, a yield farming platform with multi-chain support across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, advanced impermanent loss protection using derivatives, a governance token with quadratic voting mechanisms, MEV protection through private mempools, flash loan attack prevention systems, automated arbitrage bots that exploit price differences across 15+ exchanges, liquidity mining incentives with time-weighted rewards, cross-chain bridge security with zero-knowledge proofs, regulatory compliance for multiple jurisdictions including SEC reporting, real-time risk management with VaR calculations, integration with traditional banking systems via CBDCs, AI-powered market manipulation detection, decentralized insurance protocols, and a mobile app with institutional-grade security. The system must handle $100M+ TVL, process 10,000+ transactions per second, maintain 99.99% uptime during network congestion, comply with AML/KYC requirements across 50+ countries, implement quantum-resistant cryptography for future-proofing, and include emergency pause mechanisms for black swan events. Additional challenges: integrate with legacy banking APIs, handle extreme market volatility (2008-level crashes), prevent sandwich attacks and front-running, implement fair token distribution mechanisms, create sustainable tokenomics with deflationary mechanics, and build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure with reputation-based voting weights.",
