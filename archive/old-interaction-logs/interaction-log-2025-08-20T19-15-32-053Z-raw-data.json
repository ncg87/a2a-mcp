The system must handle $100M+ TVL, process 10,000+ transactions per second, maintain 99.99% uptime during network congestion, comply with AML/KYC requirements across 50+ countries, implement quantum-resistant cryptography for future-proofing, and include emergency pause mechanisms for black swan events. Additional challenges: integrate with legacy banking APIs, handle extreme market volatility (2008-level crashes), prevent sandwich attacks and front-running, implement fair token distribution mechanisms, create sustainable tokenomics with deflationary mechanics, and build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure with reputation-based voting weights.",
