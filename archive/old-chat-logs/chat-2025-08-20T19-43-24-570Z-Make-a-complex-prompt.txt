Key outcomes:
• Multi-chain architecture finalized with security-first approach
• Scalable solution designed for $100M+ TVL with 99.99% uptime requirements  
• Comprehensive risk mitigation strategies for flash loans, MEV, and regulatory compliance
• Advanced AI integration for market manipulation detection and automated arbitrage
• Institutional-grade security with quantum-resistant cryptography
• Seamless mobile and web interfaces with real-time portfolio management

The team has aligned on implementation priorities, identified critical dependencies, and established clear integration protocols. All agents are confident in the proposed solution architecture and ready to proceed with detailed implementation planning.

This represents one of the most comprehensive DeFi ecosystem designs we've developed, addressing both current market needs and future regulatory requirements across global jurisdictions.
