AGENT RESPONSES:


[2025-08-20T19:12:58.532Z] SYSTEM ANALYSIS_START:
Analyzing prompt complexity and requirements...

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.546Z] AI MODEL SWITCH:
From: default
To: OpenAI GPT-4
Reason: Optimal for automation tasks

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.547Z] IOT-SPECIALIST AGENT (iot-agent-001):
I can help design the IoT sensor network. I recommend using temperature, motion, light, and humidity sensors connected via Zigbee protocol for reliable mesh networking. We'll need a central hub for data aggregation.

Model Used: OpenAI GPT-4
Estimated Cost: $0.002
Response Time: 494ms

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.549Z] MACHINE-LEARNING AGENT (ml-agent-002):
For pattern recognition, I suggest implementing a time-series analysis model using LSTM networks to learn user behavior patterns. We can predict when lights should turn on/off, optimal temperature settings, and security patterns.

Model Used: OpenAI GPT-4
Estimated Cost: $0.002
Response Time: 774ms

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.551Z] AGENT INTERACTION:
iot-agent-001 → ml-agent-002: coordination
Content: Here's what I'm working on for the smart home system. How does this integrate with your machine-learning components?

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.552Z] MOBILE-DEVELOPER AGENT (mobile-dev-003):
I'll create a React Native app with real-time dashboard, remote control capabilities, and push notifications. The UI will include scene management, scheduling, and energy usage analytics with beautiful data visualizations.

Model Used: OpenAI GPT-4
Estimated Cost: $0.002
Response Time: 434ms

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.554Z] VOICE-INTEGRATION AGENT (voice-ai-004):
For voice integration, I'll implement custom Alexa Skills and Google Actions. Users can control devices with natural language like "Set living room to movie mode" or "What's the temperature upstairs?"

Model Used: OpenAI GPT-4
Estimated Cost: $0.002
Response Time: 367ms

-----------------------------------------------------------

Content: Here's what I'm working on for the smart home system. How does this integrate with your voice-integration components?

-----------------------------------------------------------

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.557Z] SYSTEM-COORDINATOR AGENT (coordinator-005):
I'll orchestrate all components. The architecture will use MQTT for IoT communication, Node.js backend with Redis for real-time data, and secure API endpoints. Everything will be containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

Model Used: OpenAI GPT-4
Estimated Cost: $0.002
Response Time: 585ms

[2025-08-20T19:12:58.565Z] AGENT DECISION (coordinator-005):
Decision Type: architecture-choice
Context: Choosing between microservices vs monolithic architecture
Chosen: microservices
Reasoning: Given the complexity and need for scalability, microservices will allow independent scaling of IoT data processing, ML inference, and mobile API components
