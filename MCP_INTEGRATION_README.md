## 🤖 How Agents Use MCP Tools

### 🔄 **Automatic Tool Selection**
Agents automatically choose relevant MCP tools based on:
- **Agent type** (research agents use web browsing)
- **Task requirements** (analysis tasks use sequential thinking)
- **Context needs** (complex decisions use decision trees)
- **Information gaps** (missing data triggers web research)

### 🎯 **Example Agent Behaviors**

**🔬 Research Agent:**
```
1. Receives task: "Analyze latest renewable energy trends"
2. Uses sequential-thinking-mcp for structured approach
3. Uses playwright-mcp to search latest research papers
4. Uses memory-mcp to store findings
5. Provides comprehensive analysis with real data
```

**🏗️ Architecture Agent:**
```
1. Receives task: "Design system architecture"
2. Uses memory-mcp to retrieve similar past designs
3. Uses sequential-thinking-mcp for decision trees
4. Uses code-execution-mcp to validate design patterns
5. Uses filesystem-mcp to save architectural diagrams
```

**📊 Data Analysis Agent:**
```
1. Receives task: "Analyze market data"
2. Uses playwright-mcp to gather current market data
3. Uses code-execution-mcp to run analysis scripts
4. Uses sequential-thinking-mcp for interpretation
5. Uses filesystem-mcp to save reports
```
