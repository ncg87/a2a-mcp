   - Implement reinforcement learning for trading strategy optimization
   - Set up A/B testing framework for strategy evaluation

6. INTEGRATION CHALLENGES
   - Handle API rate limits from exchanges (some allow only 10 requests/second)
   - Deal with network latency issues for high-frequency trading (sub-millisecond requirements)
   - Manage data inconsistencies between different exchange feeds
   - Implement fallback systems when primary trading algorithms fail
   - Handle regulatory compliance across different countries (US, EU, Asia)

7. SCALING ISSUES TO SOLVE

   - Scale from $0 to $100M AUM (Assets Under Management) in 18 months

ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS:
- Budget constraint: $2M initial funding
- 6-month MVP timeline
- Team of only 8 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend, 2 ML, 1 DevOps, 1 Security)
- Must comply with SEC, FINRA, and international regulations
- Competitors include established players with 10x the resources
- Market volatility requires algorithm adaptation in real-time
- Some integrations require 6-8 week approval processes from exchanges
