In our 15-round discussion, we delved into the concept of quantitative finance and explored potential avenues for sourcing funds. We successfully accomplished a comprehensive understanding of quantitative finance, identifying it as a field that employs mathematical and statistical modeling, computational tools, and financial theory to make predictions and decisions in financial markets. We also identified potential sources of money, including personal savings, venture capital, angel investors, and bank loans.

Key technical decisions made during the discussion involved the use of computational tools and statistical models for predictive analysis. We agreed on the importance of data integrity, the application of advanced mathematical models, and machine learning techniques in quantitative finance. We also recognized the need for risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses. The approach was to integrate these elements into a cohesive system that can make accurate predictions and aid in decision-making processes.

Our implementation readiness is high, given the expertise within the team and the clarity of the approach. We have a clear understanding of the technical requirements, the necessary risk management strategies, and the potential sources of funding for our project. This puts us in a prime position to start the implementation phase.

Our next steps involve securing the necessary funds, either through personal savings, venture capital, angel investors, or bank loans. Once the funds are secured, we will commence with the technical implementation of our approach, which includes setting up the computational tools, developing the statistical models, and integrating machine learning techniques.
